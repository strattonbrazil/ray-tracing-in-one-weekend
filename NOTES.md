# Notes

## Right handed coordinate system

Cartesian coordinate systems have a property of *handedness* that defines how
the direction of the 3rd axis in a 3D coordinate system: handed-ness can be formed
with the thumb (x-axis), first (y-axis) and second index (z-axis) fingers of
either the left or right hand causing the Z-axis to go in a different
direction.

The decision in the handedness of the coordinate system will inform the correct
definition for the *cross product*.
